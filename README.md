Digits
========

This is another digits implementation using the very basic Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-Learn

###Data
You'll need to download the **train.csv** and **test.csv** files from
kaggle.com[http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data] and put them
in the same directory as the analyzer.py application.
